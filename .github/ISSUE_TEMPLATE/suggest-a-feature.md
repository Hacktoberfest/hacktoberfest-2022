<!-- Fill out the template. Don't write inside the arrows as they will be hidden
when you post your issue.

If you have a suggestion for the website, read through the following steps:

1.  Fill out the template.
      This will help us understand what you're suggesting and why you want us
      to add it.

2.  Keep it simple.
      Make sure it's easy to understand what you're suggesting. A good way is
      to keep it to one request per GitHub issue, as we can then easily track
      feature requests.

3.  Check whether it has already been asked or added.
      You can search the existing GitHub issues to see if your feature has
      already been requested.

4.  Ask yourself: "Does this idea/feature belong as part of the website?"
      Whilst we'd love to be able to add every feature that every user wants,
      we have to keep Hacktoberfest operationally consistent and as simple as
      possible. We're also only able to handle requests for the website itself,
      not the Hacktoberfest program as a whole.

5.  Delete this line and all above lines before posting your issue! -->
